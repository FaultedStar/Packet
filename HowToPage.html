		<p><h2>Firstly, lets download your google search history</h2></p>
		
		<ol>
		<li>
		Go to your
		<a href="https://history.google.com/history/?utm_source=help" target="_blank">Web & App Activity</a> page (log in using your most active google account for best results).
		</li>
		<li>Top right corner, in the drop down menu indicated with 3 dots, select download searches. </li>
		<li>Select Create Archive</li>
		<li>The download may take some time, you will get an email when it is completed. The email will link you to your data but it will be in a format that is not easily accessible.<p>Note: this does not delete your data, only gives you a copy in JSON format</p></li>
		<li>Once your history is downloaded note that google gives you an HTML link to "display your data" but all this does is give you the file names of your new JSON files. We need to edit those JSON files to be able to work with them so select one and open in your favorite text editor.</li>
		<li>to make the JSON file more workable remove the opening tag " {"event": " and the last "}" from the text and then save as a .txt file in the same folder as the HTML that this site is comprised of. </li>
		<li>Not the name of the text file you have made and <a href="MainPage.HTML">Click here to display Main page</a></li>	
			</ol>
			<div class="aside">For marking purposes I have given you a file called example.txt which is my search history prepared to the above specifications. Google tells me not to give away my personal data and use 2 step verification but they already have access to it so what's a few more people </div>
